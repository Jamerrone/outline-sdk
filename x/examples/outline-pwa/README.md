# Outline PWA

> [!CAUTION]
> This is currently a WIP placeholder for the `outline-pwa` project. It has no actual logic in it yet.

`outline-pwa` will be an sdk example project dedicated to demonstrating how one can use CapacitorJS to wrap an existing website to make it censorship resistant. To load the site you want to test into the project, cd into this directory and run the following command:

```sh
npm run setup https://www.bbc.com/persian
```

This will update the ios and android subprojects with that site's index.html. You will then be able to open those projects in Xcode and Android Studio to see how effectively the entire site loads.
